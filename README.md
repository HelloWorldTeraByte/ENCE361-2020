# Fitness Monitor

## Introduction
The goal of this project was to apply key concepts discussed in lectures and laboratories through the design and implementation of a personal fitness monitor. The personal fitness monitor was programmed with the C programming language and in Code Composer Studio and implemented on a TIVA microcontroller with Orbit BoosterPack peripheral board. 
Key concepts applied were:The initialization and processing of GPIO pins, Using the in-board analog to digital converter (ADC), storing data in a circular buffer, I2C for sending data between components, background system timing administered through interrupts and software button debouncing.

## Getting Started
The project can be compiled using the [Code Composer Studio](http://www.ti.com/tool/CCSTUDIO). Make sure to link the ustdlib from Tivaware.
